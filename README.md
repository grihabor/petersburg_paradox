# Petersburg paradox
Little python script which simulates a number of coin flips. If k-1 times it was heads and the k-th time it turned out to be tails, then the person who plays the game gets 2^k money. But to play the game you have to pay some money. How much would you ask the person to pay if you offer the game?
